# AnimatedGraphsPresentation
This repo includes the R code shown during 4 Nov 2020 presentation to DataViz group about "animated graphs". Below is one example of a graph that I used, and which I did live coding during the presentation. The code is available on this repository.

## Software stack
My preferred solution for animation of graphics in ```R``` is to combine ```ggplot``` with ```gganimate```. This combination offers great flexibility while enabling me to just plug some animation code on top of my static graphs. Going forward, one R package that I certainly intend to explore is ```rayshader```, which should enable me to create animated graphs a bit differently, bit showing a camera view around a 3d graph. This could be useful for some types of graphs used in economics, finance and machine learning.

## Helpful references
The presentation was based on some lessons I have learned from experience, but also from studying and seeing what other people are doing. In particular, the list below includes some useful references for future study. Please note that the list is not exhaustive and not ordered by importance of quality.
